HandlebarsForVaadin
===================
This project integrates Handlebars to Vaadin on a "Hello world" -level. It might not support all Handlebars features, the loading of templates is clunky and it has no Vaadin features in it.

A deployed version might be online at http://peppe.jelastic.servint.net/handlebars.
